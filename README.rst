Characters of Darkness is a program to build characters for the tabletop RPG `Chronicles of Darkness <https://boardgamegeek.com/rpgfamily/442/chronicles-of-darkness>`__, second edition. It produces an ASCII character sheet. It's written in Hy, and is intended to be used primarily through a web form that runs the Hy code with Pyodide, with a little JavaScript glue. Overall it's pretty crude, performing only a limited set of validation logic, and assuming that you've read the character-creation rules rather than stepping you through them itself. Also, it supports only one splat, Mage, in addition to no-splat vanilla mortals.
